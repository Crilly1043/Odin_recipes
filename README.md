# Odin_recipes

This will be my first attempt at designing a website. As well as following the instructions on The Odin Project to include ordered and unordered lists, I also intend to look for suitable places to use the strong and emphasize tags. Another focus point for more will be to commit regularly and to include comments to build good habits early.
